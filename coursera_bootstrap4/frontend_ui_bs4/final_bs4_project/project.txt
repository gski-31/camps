Final Report Template
Project Title = Best Beach

1. Introduction
• This will be a yelp like site for local beaches
• Beaches will have ratings and reviews
• Top beaches will have their placement cycle to the front page
• Mockups on pages 2 and 3
• Code at: https://github.com/gski-31/coursera/tree/master/frontend_ui_bs4/final_bs4_project

2. Design and Implementation
• Nav with link to top cities, write a review and login
• jumbotron with a search option
• Top beache son page one
• This will have to pull from a database (when we get to those courses).  Each beach will have a main photo, name, rating.  Then when clicked user rating and photos can expand out.
• Maybe Express (when we get to those courses) to be more DRY

3. Conclusions
• This initial mockup was created in bootstrap
• Hopefully future versions will interact with a db and use loops to cycle through it
