Local Beach Reviews and Locations

1. Introduction
A site to explore local beaches and hidden spots people may not know of. Some beaches are grat and others not so much, I would like a reference of what is out there. 

2. Expected List of Features
• Pictures, locations, information, reviews or comments(if able), recomendations based on location, able to suggest or upload (possibly).

3. Market Survey
• Yelp - a bit beyond my ability at the moment
• Trip Advisor, cool but too complex at the moment
• Glassdoor - not beach or travel realted but good layout and same general Ideation
• https://www.sandiego.org/explore/things-to-do/beaches-bays.aspx = good page with good data
• this smore of an article but coul borrow mapping and data https://www.timeout.com/los-angeles/things-to-do/best-beaches-in-la-top-coastal-escapes-to-surf-swim-and-play


4. References
I wpould like to take what I learn here combined with whatever I can find on udemy to add this site to my portfolio.
